    <h1>Graduate Capstone Research Proposal</h1>
    <h3>What factors are contributing to the global rise of antisemitism 
        since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, and what can we 
        do about it? </h3>
    <p>3 reasons why I chose this topic:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Antisemitism has been around for over two millennia, affecting Jewish communities across the world.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>My own family was persecuted during the Holocaust.</li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a spike in antisemitic incidents.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2020, an Oakland synaguage was vandalized.</li>
                <li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Despite record-breaking levels of antisemitism, most of the world remains silent on the issue.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Around the world, news outlets, governments, and citizens aren't speaking out.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
